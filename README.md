# Exercism Perl analyzer

The Docker image to automatically run tests on Perl solutions submitted to [Exercism].

## Run the analyzer

To analyze an arbitrary exercise, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run.sh <exercise-slug> <solution-dir> <output-dir>`

Once the analyzer has finished, its results will be written to `<output-dir>/analysis.json`.

## Run the analyzer on an exercise using Docker

_This script is provided for testing purposes, as it mimics how analyzers run in Exercism's production environment._

To analyze an arbitrary exercise using the Docker image, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-in-docker.sh <exercise-slug> <solution-dir> <output-dir>`

Once the analyzer has finished, its results will be written to `<output-dir>/analysis.json`.

## Run the tests

To run the tests to verify the behavior of the analyzer, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-tests.sh`

These are [golden tests][golden] that compare the `analysis.json` generated by running the current state of the code against the "known good" `tests/<test-name>/analysis.json`. All files created during the test run itself are discarded.

When you've made modifications to the code that will result in a new "golden" state, you'll need to generate and commit a new `tests/<test-name>/analysis.json` file.
