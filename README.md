# Exercism Analyzer Template

This repository is a [template repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) for creating [analyzers][analyzers] for [Exercism][exercism] tracks.

## Using the analyzer Template

1. Ensure that your track has not already implemented a analyzer. If there is, there will be a `https://github.com/exercism/<track>-analyzer` repository (i.e. if your track's slug is `python`, the analyzer repo would be `https://github.com/exercism/python-analyzer`)
2. Follow [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for creating a repository from a template repository
   - Name your new repository based on your language track's slug (i.e. if your track is for Python, your analyzer repo name is `python-analyzer`)
3. Remove this [Exercism analyzer Template](#exercism-analyzer-template) section from the `README.md` file
4. Replace `TRACK_NAME_HERE` with your track's name in the `README.md` file
5. Replace any occurances of `exercism/analyzer` with `exercism/<track>-analyzer` (e.g. `exercism/python-analyzer`)
6. Build the analyzer, conforming to the [analyzer interface specification](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/main/building/tooling/analyzers/interface.md).
   - Update the files to match your track's needs. At the very least, you'll need to update `bin/run.sh`, `Dockerfile` and the test solutions in the `tests` directory
   - Tip: look for `TODO:` comments to point you towards code that need updating
   - Tip: look for `OPTIONAL:` comments to point you towards code that _could_ be useful

Once you're happy with your analyzer, [open an issue on the exercism/exercism](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=new-analyzer.md&title=%5BNew+Analyzer%5D+) to request an official analyzer repository for your track.

# Exercism TRACK_NAME_HERE analyzer

The Docker image to automatically run tests on TRACK_NAME_HERE solutions submitted to [Exercism].

## Run the analyzer

To analyze an arbitrary exercise, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run.sh <exercise-slug> <solution-dir> <output-dir>`

Once the analyzer has finished, its results will be written to `<output-dir>/analysis.json`.

## Run the analyzer on an exercise using Docker

_This script is provided for testing purposes, as it mimics how analyzers run in Exercism's production environment._

To analyze an arbitrary exercise using the Docker image, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-in-docker.sh <exercise-slug> <solution-dir> <output-dir>`

Once the analyzer has finished, its results will be written to `<output-dir>/analysis.json`.

## Run the tests

To run the tests to verify the behavior of the analyzer, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-tests.sh`

These are [golden tests][golden] that compare the `analysis.json` generated by running the current state of the code against the "known good" `tests/<test-name>/analysis.json`. All files created during the test run itself are discarded.

When you've made modifications to the code that will result in a new "golden" state, you'll need to generate and commit a new `tests/<test-name>/analysis.json` file.
